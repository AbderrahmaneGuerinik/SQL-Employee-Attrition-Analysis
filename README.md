# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Overview
This project explores factors influencing employee attrition using SQL-based data analysis. The dataset contains information on employee demographics, job roles, salaries, work-life balance, and more. The goal is to identify key drivers of employee turnover and provide actionable insights for improving retention.

## Key Insights
